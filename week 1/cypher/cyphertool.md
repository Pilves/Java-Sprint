## Technical Cipher Descriptions

Each function within the Cypher Tool suite is engineered to handle text transformations with precision and reliability:

- **Rot13**: The Rot13 function meticulously examines each character within the provided text. For alphabetic characters, it determines whether they are in lowercase or uppercase. It retains the original state of non-alphabetic characters, including punctuation and spaces. When encountering a letter, the function applies a shift of 13 positions forward in the alphabet. If this shift surpasses the 'z' or 'Z', it wraps around to continue from 'a' or 'A', respectively. For numeric characters, the function shifts each digit by 5, wrapping around at '9' to continue from '0'. The final result of this process is a string where each alphabetic and numeric character has been transformed, while all other characters remain unmodified, thereby producing the encrypted message.

- **Reverse**: The Reverse function takes each character in the string and maps it to its opposite by reversing its order in the alphabet. It maintains a distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving the original case. For instance, 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y', and so on, with 'A' becoming 'Z', 'B' becoming 'Y'. Numbers are similarly flipped, with '0' turning into '9', '1' into '8', etc. Unaffected by this operation are non-alphabetic and non-numeric characters, which remain unaltered.

- **Base64**: This encoding function first converts each character into its ASCII binary equivalent, forming a continuous binary stream. It then segments this stream into sets of 6 bits, each corresponding to a value between 0 and 63. Each 6-bit group is mapped to a specific character in the Base64 character set, which includes a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and a couple of symbols. Upon decoding, the function reverses this process to retrieve the original ASCII characters from the encoded string.
