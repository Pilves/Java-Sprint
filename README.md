# Kood/Jõhvi Selection Sprint Exercises in Java

This repository contains a collection of exercises rewritten in Java from the Kood/Jõhvi Selection Sprint. Each exercise is designed to enhance your understanding of Java, a statically typed language where you must declare the type of each variable.

## Features

Java requires that you specify the type of each variable before its declaration. Here's a basic example to illustrate this:

```java
int number = 10; // Declares an integer variable
String text = "Hello, Java!"; // Declares a string variable
```
