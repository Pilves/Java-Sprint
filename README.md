these are the Kood/Jõhvi Selection Sprint excercises, rewritten in Java.

Java is a statically typed language, so you need to declare the type of each variable. This is done by writing the type before the variable name, like this:
```java

```
in this repo you can find excerxises like:

Group Task 01
Cypher Tool
    Instructions
    You are tasked with creating a command-line tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using various encryption techniques.
    The program has to do the following:
    
    Greet the user
    Allow the user to select the operation (encrypt or decrypt)
    Allow the user to select the encryption type
    Allow the user to input the message to encrypt/decrypt
    Output the result of the operation
    If user input is invalid, the program should keep prompting the user to input again, until valid input is provided. Before validatid the input, it has to be trimmed (remove whitespaces from the beginning and the end of the input).
    When encrypting or decrypting, ensure that any non-alphabet characters in the message are left unchanged.
    The tool has to support two encryptions:
    rot13, similar to ShiftBy you created for a single rune.
    reverse, similar to ReverseAlphabetValue you created for a single rune.
    One more encryption of your choice.
    You also have to make a brief description in Markdown, that at least:
    Explains what the tool does
    Explains the usage of the tool, with example
    Explains the cyphers used

Arrays
You are already here? Cool! Learn about array manipulations, modular programming and optimization!

- Is Lower?
- Is Numeric?
- TO UPPER CASE
- to Capital Case
- Str Concat With
- Split on Whitespaces
- Str Split By
- Substring Index
- Str Compare
- Number to Base
- Convert Any to Decimal
- Convert Any to Any

- Unique Accumulate
- From Binary
- Combn

Group Task 02
Notes Tool
    Instructions
    You are tasked with creating a command-line tool that allows users to create, read, update and delete notes.
    The program has to do the following:
    
    Greet the user
    Allow the user to select the operation (create, read, update, delete)
    If the user selects create, allow the user to input the note title and note content
    If the user selects read, allow the user to input the note title and output the note content
    If the user selects update, allow the user to input the note title and note content
    If the user selects delete, allow the user to input the note title and delete the note
    If user input is invalid, the program should keep prompting the user to input again, until valid input is provided. Before validating the input, it has to be trimmed (remove whitespaces from the beginning and the end of the input).
    The tool has to store the notes in a file, in a format of your choice.
    You also have to make a brief description in Markdown, that at least:
    Explains what the tool does
    Explains the usage of the tool, with example
    Explains the file format used
